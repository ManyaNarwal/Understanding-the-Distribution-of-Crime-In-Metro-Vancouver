# Understanding-the-Distribution-of-Crime-In-Metro-Vancouver


This project analyzes Vancouver crime data, sourced from the PRIME BC Police Records Management System with the intention of enhancing community awareness on policing activities and frequencies of crimes committed in Metro Vancouver. Since the data set contains information on a plethora of crime categories, we have decided to concentrate on one specific category “Theft from Vehicle”, to perform our larger analysis (our hypothesis test), while performing minor analysis/comparisons on other categories of crimes. And so, for our hypothesis, we are going to compare the proportion of “Theft from Vehicle” crimes occurring in two distinct neighborhoods, “West End” and “Central Business District”. These specific locations were chosen due to high population density and visitation rates, and we are predicting that there will be no difference in crime rates between the two locations. The goal of this analysis is to identify if there is a difference between crime rates in the defined locations, which could lead to further investigations why there is/isn’t a difference.
